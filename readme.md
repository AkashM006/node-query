# Boilerplate Express Project

This repository hosts the boilerplate code that I use mostly. In order to boost productivity it has been hosted online.

# How to run the project

- Download the project and use yarn/npm to install all the dependencies.

> `yarn` / `npm i`

- Then create a **.env** file and fill the following contents.

> PORT=3000

> DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:Abcd@1234@localhost:5432/test"

> ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET= Some random long string

> REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET= Some random long string

> SALT_ROUNDS=12

_Note: the database url might change based on your settings. The format for it somewhat like this: postgresql://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]_

- Run the following command on the terminal to start the server

`yarn dev` / `npm run dev`

# Swagger

Swagger is a tool used for documenting APIs so that anyone using this can understand how the responses are and what the required parameters are without having to take a glance at the code for that.

For this project swagger is setup such that the docs are available in [localhost:3000/api/docs](http://localhost:3000/api/docs) once the project is run.

When adding new routes to the app by creating new files in the routes folder, also add the open api decorator to make them appear in swagger docs.
